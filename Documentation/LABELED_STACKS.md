# ✅ LABELED: Done & Scheduled Labels Added to Chart!

## 🎉 What's New:

Each stack now has **clear labels** showing whether it's "Done" or "Scheduled"!

### Visual Example:
```
Status by Category
Compare Done vs Scheduled stacks monthly

      $3000 │
      $2500 │              ██ ██
      $2000 │       ██ ██  ██ ██
      $1500 │  ██ ██ ██ ██  ██ ██
      $1000 │  ██ ██ ██ ██  ██ ██
       $500 │  ██ ██ ██ ██  ██ ██
         $0 │────────────────────────────
            │Done Sched Done Sched Done Sched
            │← Jan →  ← Feb →  ← Mar →
            
Each pair represents one month!
```

## 🎯 How It Works:

### X-Axis Labels:
```
Pattern repeats for each month:
Done | Scheduled | Done | Scheduled | Done | Scheduled
  January        February        March
```

### Clear Identification:
- **"Done"** label = Left stack (completed transactions)
- **"Scheduled"** label = Right stack (planned transactions)
- Labels alternate for each month

### Example for January:
```
   Done      Scheduled
    ██          ██
    ██          ██
    ██          ██
  ──────────────────
  Done      Scheduled
     ← January →
```

## 💡 Benefits:

### No More Guessing:
✅ **Clear labels** - Know which stack is which at a glance  
✅ **Always visible** - Labels shown permanently  
✅ **No hover needed** - Immediately obvious  
✅ **Easy comparison** - Labels help you compare  

### Better Understanding:
```
Before: "Which stack is Done? Which is Scheduled?"
After: Labels clearly show "Done" and "Scheduled"
```

---

## 🔍 How to Read:

### Step 1: Find the Month
```
Look at the groups of 2 stacks
Each pair = 1 month
```

### Step 2: Check the Labels
```
Left stack label: "Done"
Right stack label: "Scheduled"
```

### Step 3: Compare Heights
```
Done stack taller:
→ More completed than planned

Scheduled stack taller:
→ More planned than completed
```

## 📊 Example Reading:

### January Analysis:
```
Labels show:
   Done | Scheduled
    ██  |   ██
    ██  |   ██
    ██  |   ██
   $800 |  $1,200

Reading:
- January Done: $800
- January Scheduled: $1,200
- More planned than completed
- Scheduled stack is taller
```

### February Analysis:
```
Labels show:
   Done | Scheduled
    ██  |   ██
    ██  |   
    ██  |   
  $1,500|  $500

Reading:
- February Done: $1,500
- February Scheduled: $500
- More completed than planned
- Done stack is taller
```

## 🎨 Visual Clarity:

### Labels Position:
- **X-axis bottom** - Directly under each stack
- **Alternating pattern** - Done, Scheduled, Done, Scheduled...
- **X-axis title** - "Month & Status"

### Label Text:
- **"Done"** - Under left stack of each month
- **"Scheduled"** - Under right stack of each month
- **Small font** - Doesn't clutter the chart
- **Clear text** - Easy to read

## 💡 Quick Tips:

### Tip 1: Scan Left to Right
```
Read across months:
January Done → January Scheduled → February Done → February Scheduled...
```

### Tip 2: Compare Pairs
```
For each month, compare:
Done (left) vs Scheduled (right)
```

### Tip 3: Look for Patterns
```
All Done labels have tall stacks:
→ High spending activity

All Scheduled labels have tall stacks:
→ Good planning ahead
```

### Tip 4: Use Colors Too
```
Labels + Colors = Complete picture
Red segment in Done: Food completed
Red segment in Scheduled: Food planned
```

## 🧪 How to Verify:

### Test 1: Check Labels
```
Steps:
1. Go to Analytics tab
2. Find "Status by Category" (2nd chart)
3. Look at X-axis labels

Expected:
- Alternating "Done" and "Scheduled"
- Pattern repeats for each month
```

### Test 2: Count Labels
```
If you have 3 months:
Expected: 6 labels
(Done, Scheduled) × 3 months = 6 labels
```

### Test 3: Match Stacks to Labels
```
Steps:
1. Find a "Done" label
2. Look at stack above it

Expected: This is the Done stack

3. Find a "Scheduled" label
4. Look at stack above it

Expected: This is the Scheduled stack
```
