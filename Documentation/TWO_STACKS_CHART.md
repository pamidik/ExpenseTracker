```
Done taller than Scheduled:

```

### Compare Colors Within Stacks:
```
Red dominates Done stack:
→ Food is biggest Done expense

Yellow dominates Scheduled stack:
→ Travel is biggest Scheduled expense
```

### Track Across Months:
```
Done stacks growing:
→ Spending increasing

Scheduled stacks growing:
→ Planning increasing

Gap growing between stacks:
→ More planning ahead
```
